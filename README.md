## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

### Methodology

####CSS
Took all of the CSS and made it 'productoin' inline quality
Used media= where accpetable. For mobile.css was still receiving an issue and so I simple styled it inline at the beginning as a 'gut check'

####JS
Made all of the javascript async
Attempted to utilize javascript for on the move rendering and it took my page speed down from high 80's to low 60s.

####Browser Caching
Because of how everything seemed to be working utilizing .htaccess (file included) seemed not to work with github (since I don't have access to the server proper) and localhost appears to not be properly setup to take it. I did follow instructions as best I could.

### Pizza FPS





### Getting started ####


####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).
