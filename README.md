## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

### Methodology

####CSS
Took all of the CSS and made it 'productoin' inline quality
Used media= where accpetable. For mobile.css was still receiving an issue and so I simple styled it inline at the beginning as a 'gut check'

####JS
Made all of the javascript async
Attempted to utilize javascript for on the move rendering and it took my page speed down from high 80's to low 60s.

####Browser Caching
Because of how everything seemed to be working utilizing .htaccess (file included) seemed not to work with github (since I don't have access to the server proper) and localhost appears to not be properly setup to take it. I did follow instructions as best I could.
